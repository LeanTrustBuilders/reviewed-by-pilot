"""Record review marks and problem reports on Tau Ceti declarations, without a pull request.

  python3 scripts/reviews.py from-event <event.json> --reply reply.md --out <file>

A mark is a kernel-style trailer, Reviewed-by: it is the intended mathematical
notion. Two ways in, both from a browser:

- the "Review a definition" issue form (label `review`), usually opened from a
  "Review this" link that fills in the declaration and the version shown;
- lines `Reviewed-by: <declaration> — <evidence>` in a comment on an issue
  labelled `reviews`, one mark per line. An AI agent puts the marker
  <!--reviewed-by:v1 {"agent": "<agent, model, session>"}--> in the comment.

A person need not say why a declaration is right; an AI review must give its
evidence. Each mark is appended to reviews/records.jsonl with the GitHub
account that submitted it, which GitHub authenticates, and the version of the
declaration it was made on. The page shows it, greyed once the declaration
changes.

What a declaration is tested by is not a mark but a list of tests it passes:
its unit tests (Tau Ceti's examples that name it, read by
fetch_declarations.py), key results listed with lines
`Test: <declaration> — <result that tests it> — what it checks` in a comment
on the `reviews` issue (reviews/tests.jsonl), and tests anyone suggests with
the "Suggest a test" form (label `test-suggestion`), each an issue that stays
open until the test is written (reviews/suggestions.jsonl).

Lines `Named: <declaration> — <name> — <a sentence>` in the same comments add a
declaration to the list of named results and notable definitions
(reviews/named.jsonl), which Voyager writes to after each announcement; the
roadmaps' own named results are read from their status files (scripts/named.py).

A problem report says that a declaration is wrong, and why: the "Report a
problem" form (label `problem`), opened from the page. The report is the issue
that gets the declaration fixed, so it stays open. Its events (reported, edited,
closed as fixed or not, reopened) are appended to reviews/problems.jsonl, and the
page shows the report on the declaration until its issue is closed.
